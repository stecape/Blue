# Getting Started
You need a Postgres database running. Docker is a good solution.

configure your preferences in `server\src\DB\db_config.js`
configure your preferences in `server\src\App\app_config.js`

You need a MQTT Broker running somewhere. A good solution is to use Doker and run an istance of Eclipse/mosquitto.
Remember to customize the `\mosquitto\config\mosquitto.config` adding:
`listener 1883`
`allow_anonymous true`

Of course the outer port must be `1883`

### `npm install`
